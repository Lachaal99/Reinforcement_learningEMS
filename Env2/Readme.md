# Advanced EMS with Electric Vehicles and Load Management

## ⚡ Enhanced Energy Management System Environment

This repository implements sophisticated Reinforcement Learning agents for managing complex Energy Management Systems (EMS) with **Electric Vehicle integration** and **heterogeneous load types**. Building upon previous implementations, this environment introduces real-world complexities that require more advanced control strategies.

## 🎯 Core Innovations

### **1. Electric Vehicle Integration**
- **EV Charging/Discharging** (V2G - Vehicle-to-Grid capabilities)
- **Dynamic EV Availability** (Arrival/departure patterns)
- **Battery Degradation Models** for both stationary and vehicle batteries
- **User Convenience Constraints** (minimum charge levels, departure deadlines)

### **2. Heterogeneous Load Management**
- **Shiftable Loads**: Can be moved in time (washing machines, EV charging)
- **Non-shiftable Loads**: Must be served immediately (lighting, refrigeration)
- **Critical Loads**: Must always be served (medical equipment)
- **Thermal Loads**: HVAC systems with thermal inertia
