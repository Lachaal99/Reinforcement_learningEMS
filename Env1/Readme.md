# Reinforcement Learning for Energy Management Systems (EMS)

This repository contains implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms applied to Energy Management Systems (EMS). It serves as a modular laboratory for experimenting with RL techniques in energy control and optimization scenarios.

## 🚀 Overview

This project implements multiple reinforcement learning algorithms for EMS applications, featuring customized environments and both discrete/continuous action spaces. The repository is structured to facilitate experimentation, comparison, and deployment of RL agents in energy management contexts.

## 📊 Implemented Algorithms

| Algorithm | State Space | Action Space | Implementation Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Q-Learning** | Discrete | Discrete | ✅ Complete |
| **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** | Continuous | Discrete | ✅ Complete |
| **Model Predictive Control (MPC)** | Continuous | Continuous | ✅ Complete |
| **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)** | Continuous | Continuous | ✅ Complete |

**Time Step Configuration:** All implementations use a **1-hour time step** for environment simulation.
